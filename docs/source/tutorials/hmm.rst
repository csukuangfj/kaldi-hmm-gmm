Hmm topology
============

A non-emitting state has no pdf classes associated with it.
Pdf class with -1 means there is no pdf class at all. Valid pdf class starts from 0
and pdf classes are contiguous.

For HMM topology, the forward pdf class and self-loop pdf class are identical for every
state. Otherwise, it is a non-HMM topology.
